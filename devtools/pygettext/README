pygettext has problems handling plural forms. http://bugs.python.org/issue8502

I took the original pygettext2.7 script, and applied the patch mentioned in the issue.
This way the hlm_i18n module can work (almost) correctly.
Too bad extracted comments still don't work, but I guess we don't really need them.
